# FatFone
The 2nd generation of [poDuino](https://github.com/Nanohenry10-9/poDuino).

Uses the [Adafruit 2.8" TFT Shield for Arduino w/ Capacitive Touch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2468), [Adafruit Fona 800 Shield for Arduino](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1947) (with a loudspaker, microphone, a mini vibrator motor and a 1200mAh 3.7 volt battery), an [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno), a pushbutton and a RGB LED.

FatFone is a simple mobile phone that can be used to make calls or receive calls. It also has a FM receiver, which is not used in the code because the flash memory limitations.

Future implementations (I already know how to make these, but there's only a small bit of flash memeory left):
- SMS sending/receiving
- Phone book
- Pong game
- Use RGB LED to display status (battery state, are there any new phone calls etc.)
